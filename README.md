## 📌 Project Purpose
This project is part of my data analysis portfolio, demonstrating the ability to:
- Build interactive dashboards in Excel  
- Summarize business data with KPIs and charts  
- Provide actionable insights through data visualization

 ## 🔍 Data Preparation & Analysis

Before building the dashboard, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data cleaning** to ensure data accuracy and reliability.  
Key steps included:
- Handling missing or inconsistent values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Standardizing category and subcategory names  
- Calculating additional metrics such as average discount percentage and average rating  
- Analyzing trends across categories and subcategories  

This process helped transform raw data into meaningful insights that were then visualized in the dashboard.
